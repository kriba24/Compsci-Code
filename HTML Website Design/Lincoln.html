        <p>Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth   
        upon this continent a new nation: conceived in liberty, and   
        dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now   
        we are engaged in a great civil war. . .testing whether that   
        nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long   
        endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. </p>  
           
        <p>We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final   
        resting place for those who here gave their lives that that   
        nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we   
        should do this. </p>    
           
        <p>But, in a larger sense, we cannot   
        dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.   
        The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have   
        consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The   
        world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but   
        it can never forget what they did here. </p>
