            As a young child, he couldn't speak much Urdu or Gujrati, but was fluent in English. As a result, he became a lawyer at the age of 20.
            He was in Britain in 1914, where he met his rival Mohatma Gandhi, where they talked. In 1915, Jinnah returned to his home. In 1918, he got married to his second wife Rattanbai Petit
            who was 24 years younger than him.

                In the 1930s, he became interested in the Pakistan movement. In 1939, shortly after the declatation of WWI, there was a Lahore Resolution where they agreed that Muslims would live in the northwestern part, now called Pakistan, and the Hindus would live in the 
                south-eastern portion, now called India. On August 14, 1947, British India was granted independence, and the  Pakistan movement happened. The former India was partitioned into Pakistan on the west, 
                and India on the right.
